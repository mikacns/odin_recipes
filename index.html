    <p> This has been a tough couple of years. On a positive side, my wife got to discover new hobies since she suddenly had a lot of free time due to Covid. </p>
        
        <p>Luckily for me (but unfortunately for my weight scale), this new hobby included baking! To be more precise, baking delicious, high quality cookies. I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to share my love for my wife's cookies with the world! </p>
    <p> Below are only some of the recipes, for the most delicious ones. My current favorite is the brownie cookie, but this is subject to a change!</p>
